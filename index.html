      <h3>Booking and Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        Booking Process: Once users find a suitable roommate or room listing, they can initiate the booking process. This typically involves sending a booking request to the lister, expressing their interest in renting the room or becoming a roommate. The booking request may include details such as the desired move-in date, duration of stay, and any specific requirements or questions.<br>

        Confirmation and Acceptance: The lister reviews the booking request and decides whether to accept or decline it. If the booking is accepted, both parties proceed with the necessary arrangements, such as signing a rental agreement or discussing further details.<br>
        
        Payment Handling: Depending on the website's setup, the booking process may involve handling payments. This can include payment of rent, security deposits, or any applicable fees. The website may provide secure payment options and facilitate the transfer of funds between the involved parties.<br>
        
        Review and Rating System: After the booking period is completed or the roommate arrangement has ended, both the lister and the tenant can leave reviews and ratings for each other. These reviews serve as feedback on the experience, allowing users to share their satisfaction, highlight positive aspects, and provide constructive criticism if needed. The rating system often uses a numerical scale or star rating to summarize the overall experience.<br>
        
        Review Content: Users can provide written reviews sharing their impressions, describing their interactions, and commenting on the accuracy of the listing information. They can mention aspects such as cleanliness, communication, adherence to agreements, and overall satisfaction. These reviews help future users gain insights into the reliability, trustworthiness, and compatibility of potential roommates or listings.<br>
        
        Review Display: The website may display reviews and ratings alongside the respective roommate or room listings. This enables users to read the feedback shared by others and make more informed decisions when considering a particular roommate or room.</p>
