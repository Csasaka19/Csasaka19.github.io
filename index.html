      <h3>User Profile Management</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>User Registration:</strong> The website allows users to create accounts by registering with their basic information such as name, email, and phone number. This process typically involves a registration form where users provide the required details and choose a username and password for their account.<br>

        <strong>Profile Creation:</strong> Once registered, users can create their profiles by providing additional information such as their budget, location preferences, gender, and age. This information helps in matching users with suitable roommates or rooms based on their preferences and requirements.<br>
        
        <strong>Profile Editing:</strong> Users have the ability to edit and update their profile information whenever needed. This allows them to modify their budget, location preferences, or any other relevant details as their circumstances change.<br>
        
        <strong>Preferences and Settings:</strong> The website may offer options for users to set their preferences and customize their experience. This could include preferences for dwelling types (e.g., room, house, apartment), room size, gender preference for roommates, and other specific requirements they may have.<br>
        
        <strong>Profile Visibility:</strong> Users may have control over the visibility of their profile. They can choose to make their profile public or limit it to registered users only. This gives users the flexibility to decide who can view their profile and contact them.<br>
        
        <strong>Communication and Messaging:</strong> The website may provide a messaging system or contact information exchange platform for users to communicate with potential roommates or room listers. This facilitates the process of discussing details, arranging viewings, and making arrangements for living together.<br></p>

      <h3>Roommate and Room Listing</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Roommate Listing:</strong> Users who have an available room in their dwelling can create listings to find suitable roommates. They provide details about the available room, such as the description, price, availability, address, and any specific preferences they may have for potential roommates (e.g., gender, occupation, lifestyle).<br>
        
        <strong>Room Listing:</strong> Users who are looking for a room to rent can create listings specifying their requirements and preferences. They provide details about their desired room, such as the desired location, budget, room size, preferred dwelling type, and any specific requirements they may have (e.g., furnished/unfurnished).<br>
        
        <strong>Search and Filtering:</strong> The website provides search functionality for users to find roommates or rooms based on their preferences. Users can apply various filters such as location, dwelling type, room size, price range, and other specific criteria to narrow down their search results.<br>
        
        <strong>Listing Display:</strong> The search results display the available roommates or rooms based on the user's search criteria. Each listing includes relevant information such as the description, price, location, and any additional details provided by the lister.<br>
        
        <strong>Messaging and Contact:</strong> Users interested in a particular roommate or room listing can initiate communication through the website's messaging system or contact information provided by the lister. This allows users to discuss further details, ask questions, and potentially arrange viewings or interviews.<br>
        
        <strong>Review and Rating:</strong> After a successful roommate match or room rental, users can leave reviews and ratings for each other. This feedback system helps build trust and credibility within the community. It enables future users to make informed decisions based on the experiences shared by previous users.</p>

    <div class="feature">
      <img src="images/booking.jpg" alt="Booking and Reviews">
      <h3>Booking and Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Booking Process:</strong> Once users find a suitable roommate or room listing, they can initiate the booking process. This typically involves sending a booking request to the lister, expressing their interest in renting the room or becoming a roommate. The booking request may include details such as the desired move-in date, duration of stay, and any specific requirements or questions.<br>

        <strong>Confirmation and Acceptance:</strong> The lister reviews the booking request and decides whether to accept or decline it. If the booking is accepted, both parties proceed with the necessary arrangements, such as signing a rental agreement or discussing further details.<br>
        
        <strong>Payment Handling:</strong> Depending on the website's setup, the booking process may involve handling payments. This can include payment of rent, security deposits, or any applicable fees. The website may provide secure payment options and facilitate the transfer of funds between the involved parties.<br>
        
        <strong>Review and Rating System:</strong> After the booking period is completed or the roommate arrangement has ended, both the lister and the tenant can leave reviews and ratings for each other. These reviews serve as feedback on the experience, allowing users to share their satisfaction, highlight positive aspects, and provide constructive criticism if needed. The rating system often uses a numerical scale or star rating to summarize the overall experience.<br>
        
        <strong>Review Content:</strong> Users can provide written reviews sharing their impressions, describing their interactions, and commenting on the accuracy of the listing information. They can mention aspects such as cleanliness, communication, adherence to agreements, and overall satisfaction. These reviews help future users gain insights into the reliability, trustworthiness, and compatibility of potential roommates or listings.<br>
        
        <strong>Review Display:</strong> The website may display reviews and ratings alongside the respective roommate or room listings. This enables users to read the feedback shared by others and make more informed decisions when considering a particular roommate or room.</p>
